# Logistic_Class_Reg

This study introduces a dataset comprising information of 101,766 patient records across 48 attributes, aimed at unraveling the underlying factors influencing hospital readmittance. These attributes span patient demographics such as race, age, and gender, as well as more medical characteristics like time spent in the hospital, number and type of diagnoses, laboratory procedures undertaken, medications administered, and more.
The dataset provides insights into various aspects of a patient's hospital journey, including the type and source of their admission, the specialty of the attending medical practitioner, and their discharge disposition. Crucially, the data also captures specifics about diabetes medications, shedding light on potential relationships between medication regimes and readmittance rates. The ultimate objective of this exploration is to employ a logistic regression classifier to predict the likelihood of a patient's readmittance based on these diverse features. This has the potential to inform clinical decision-making as well as driving administrative strategies to optimize patient care and resource allocation.
